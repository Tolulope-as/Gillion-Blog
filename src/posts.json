The code doesn't care who wrote it, the project doesn't care who led it, and decisions don't care who took them.This gender gap in technology is not only a missed opportunity for women but also a loss for the industry. This is because diverse teams have been shown to outperform homogeneous ones. Women in tech face a range of challenges, including gender bias, stereotyping, lack of representation, and unequal pay. ",
        "1. Pay Disparity in the Tech Industry",
        "The biggest myth that people live by is that there is no pay disparity in tech based on gender. And the saddest part is that people justify this pay disparity with logic. Some arguments say: Roles, working hours, skills-set, experience, or efficiency might differ and as a consequence women might get paid less than men. However, enough research and studies show it's not uncommon for women in the tech industry to experience pay disparities compared to their male counterparts. ",
        "2. Being the Only Woman in the ROne of the biggest challenges for women in tech is being the only woman in their workplace or on their team. Some people may not even consider it an issue. Or a question may pop up: How is being the only woman in the room challenging? The following reasons explain why being the only woman in a room is challenging: Feeling Isolated: This can lead to feelings of isolation and a sense of not belonging, which can be incredibly demotivating.The constant need to prove competence: When women are the only ones in a room of predominantly male colleagues, it can be challenging to feel like they belong. ",
        "3.Sexual Harassment",
        "In some countries female employees are sometimes forced into having sexual based relationship with their bosses in order to secure and keep their job , non-compliance could resultnin assault or sacking of the innocent employee and there are many more challenges faced by women in this industry like:Balancing work and personal life."
